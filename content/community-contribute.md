Modus is constantly evolving in order to expand component usage definitions and guidelines, include multiple platforms, design patterns, and code libraries. In this iterative process the UX community is key. We welcome your contributions and feedback in order to ensure a collaborative process so that Modus continues to meet the needs of your respective products.

To that end, we have outlined a process for the following:

- revision and addition of new components,
- contributions and feedback from the community,
- communication of proposed changes,
- new pattern/ component requests.
