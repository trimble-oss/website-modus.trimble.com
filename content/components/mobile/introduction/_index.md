## Overview

The mobile library for native apps Modus components and elements for designing and developing consistent mobile applications and workflows. These components are available for native or cross-platform applications on iOS and Android devices. Modus Mobile UI Kits are available in Figma and Adobe XD for designers.

## Modus Web UI Kits

Modus Mobile UI Kits are available in [Figma and Adobe XD for designers](/designers/).

## Gestures

There are a range of gestures which can be used to interact with a mobile app:

- One-finger Single Tap
- One-finger Double Tap
- Two-finger Double Tap
- One-finger Press & Hold
- One-finger Panning
- Two-finger Rotate
- Two-finger Zoom-in (Spread)
- Two-finger Zoom-out (Pinch)
- Two-finger Tilt (2D/3D)

### One Finger Tap

A one-finger single tap is often used to trigger a single event and may vary based on use case. Common uses are but may not be limited to, making a selection, dropping a pin, displaying a map popup, displaying geolocation.

### One Finger Double Tap

A one-finger double tap is commonly used to zoom-in one level.

### Two Finger Double Tap

A two-finger double tap is commonly used to zoom-out one level.

### One-finger Press & Hold

A one-finger press & hold gesture can also be used to trigger a single event such displaying a popup or other information. This should only be used when the one-finger tap interaction is assigned to a different event.

### One-finger Panning

Panning is typically a single-finger interaction. To pan, tap & hold the map with one finger and drag in any direction. A similar two-finger interaction can also be used when "tilt" is not part of the map interaction.

### Two-finger Rotate

To rotate a map, tap & hold 2 fingers on map and use a rotation gesture.

### Two-finger Zoom-In (Spread)

Zooming in can also be done by using two-fingers and a "spread" gesture.

### Zoom-Out (Pinch)

To zoom out, using two-fingers, use a pinch gesture.

### Tilt (2D/3D)

Some map applications can render their maps in both 2D & 3D view. To transition between 2D & 3D, with two-fingers use a push gesture to tilt map forward for 3D. To return to 2D, use two-fingers and a pull gesture.
