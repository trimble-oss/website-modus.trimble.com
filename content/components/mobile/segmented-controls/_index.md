## Overview

Segmented controls allow users to make a single selection from a set of 2â€“5 options, as a common alternative to radio buttons and dropdown menus. They clearly present all available options to users and are easy to use on mobile devices and tablets.

## Usage

#### Use when

- You need to provide closely related choices that affect an object, state, or view.
- You need to reduce cognitive load and/or other selection controls are inadequate.

#### Don't use when

- Enabling actions, such as adding, removing, or editing content.
- Filtering or navigating content (use [Tabs](/components/mobile/tabs/) instead).
- There are too many segments causing crowding.
