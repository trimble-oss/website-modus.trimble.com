- Always have a text label within the button container. Icons are optional.
- Make buttons look and feel clickable.
- If using multiple buttons, label them distinctly.
- The size of the buttons should be used in proportion to the context and content around it.

### Floating Action Buttons

Floating action buttons (FABs) are used for the primary or most common action on a screen. They appear at the highest level "floating" above screen content thus they include a dropshadow to evoke a sense of depth. Circular & pill shapes are often used for these buttons. Recommended sizes are 56px and 48px. Secondary color may also be used if necessary.

#### Placement

FABs can attach to top or bottom of app bars and the edge of some components.

### Disabled Buttons

**The use of disabled buttons is highly discouraged.** There are a few acceptable uses:

- When an option is unavailable, such as an item or product.
- The button has been clicked, and the system is processing the initial request. The button can be disabled to prevent the user from trying to submit a duplicate request and hitting the server multiple times.
- When a user is editing a form, but the application has not detected any changes made by the user.

### Editorial

- All buttons in the Modus Design System employ **sentence case**.
- Label a button with a verb, like “Copy”, or verb-phrase, like “Copy document.”
- Strive for short button labels that clearly describe an action.
- Try to limit button labels to three words or less. Using one or two words, if possible, is ideal.
- When writing buttons, you can remove most prepositions and articles (e.g. a, an, the).
- If a question is asked in a modal, use button labels that match the question. Keep in mind the following guidelines as well:
  - Don’t use OK/Cancel to answer yes or no questions.
  - Make sure you keep “your” and “my” consistent.
  - Avoid saying “click” when referring to buttons (and other UI elements).
