- Always have a label next to the text field, either above, on the left side or login in the input.
- Label text should always be visible.
- Display the validation state clearly. The validation message will replace Helper Text
- Try to make Label text concise. Where it must be longer (due to language translation), the label text can wrap to a second line. Truncate label at end of second line if absolutely necessary.
- Don't add validation text under helper text, as their appearance will shift content.

## Behavior

## Editorial

- When possible, add helper text below an input to further clarify selections or validation errors.
- Always mark **required** fields with an \* .
- Provide input constraints, such as a character limit within a text entry box, to provide users with guidelines and improve form efficiency.
- Use multi-step forms when necessary by breaking up inputs into distinct categories.
- Provide clear and obvious action buttons. Form submission [Buttons](/components/mobile/buttons/) should be primary.
