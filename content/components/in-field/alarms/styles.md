### Behaviors

- Alarms indicate that a show-stopping condition exists. The operator may NOT continue to work.
- The system is unable to function until the underlying issue is addressed. Unresolved alarms will also appear in the Alarms & Alerts message tray under the Bell icon in the Action bar.
- Unresolved alarms that are related to onboard devices, or other configuration errors will result in red Dashboard tiles.
- Unresolved alarms may also result in error messages in other sections of the software.

### Editorial

- Messages should be brief, written in full sentences with proper punctuation.
- They should provide the user with helpful, contextual information about a possible action or a set of data.
