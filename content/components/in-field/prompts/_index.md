## Overview

A Prompt is a type of message that requires user engagement, either to make a decision or to know about some system event. They may be of any status type, typically "error" or "warning".

There are two types of prompt triggering conditions:

1. Resolvable Prompts: condition goes away once user has made a choice.

2. Active Prompts: relates to a system event (e.g. hardware failure) to be resolved. An active prompt can either be dismissed by the condition being resolved or the user acknowledging the message.

## Usage

#### Use when

- The user is informed of a situation requiring their attention and action.

#### Don't use when

- There is a system critical action the user must take. If the user should stop work and immediately attend to a problem or error, do NOT use a Prompt. An alarm is used for such scenarios. See [Alarms](/components/in-field/alarms/) for more information.
- You need to display minor information that is "nice-to-know" but does not require the user to take any action. Use a [Notification](/components/in-field/notifications/) for scenarios where basic information needs to be conveyed to the user but does not require user action.

Basic Prompt message with heading text only.

{{< img src="/img/in-field/prompts-example-1.svg" dark="/img/in-field/prompts-example-1-dark.svg" width="100%" alt="Prompts Example 1" >}}

When more information is required add sub-text.

{{< img src="/img/in-field/prompts-example-2.svg" dark="/img/in-field/prompts-example-2-dark.svg" width="100%" alt="Prompts Example 2" >}}
