## Prompts

- Appear on top of the main content container.
- Stretch horizontally to fill 100% of the container they are placed in.
  - Always follow [typography line length guidelines](/foundations/typography/#line-length) when displaying prompts.
- Overlays over content on a page
- Can include tint to add extra emphasis or to increase contrast with page content. When changing background color, make sure the text and icons pass [contrast ratio requirements](/foundations/accessibility/).
- Remain on the page until dismissed.

### Editorial

- Keep titles short if possible.
- For titles, use title case and capitalize prepositions of four letters or more.
- Messages should tell the user what’s happening and whether they need to act to successfully keep moving through a task. Warning alerts might tell a user what could happen if they don’t address what they’re being warned about.
- For messages, use full sentences with punctuation. Use sentence case.
- Unordered lists offer a structured format to present:
  - Items needing resolution
  - Guidelines to successful completion
  - Ways to resolve problems

**Note:** Focus state uses “global blue”.
