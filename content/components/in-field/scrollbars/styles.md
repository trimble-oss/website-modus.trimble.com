### Anatomy of a Scrollbar

- Always offer a visible scrollbar if an area has scrolling content. Do not rely on auto-scrolling or on dragging. The user might not realize there is more content to scroll through.
- Hide scrollbards if all content is visible. If users see a scrollbar, they assume there's additional content and will be frustrated if they can't scroll.
- Avoid horizontal scrolling.
- Scrollbars with arrows offer the best usability.

## Types

- **Minimal:** Minimal scrollbars are best, when you need to eliminate all possible distractions. They are visually unobtrusive but may create usability problems, especially for users with disabilities.
- **Default:** Recommended option for mobile interfaces.
- **With Buttons:** These scrollbars are larger and easier to use especially in the field. They offer the best usability.
