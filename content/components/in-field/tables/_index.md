## Overview

Tables are largely based on the [List](/components/in-field/lists/) component. Tables can be stacked horizontally and vertically in multiple rows and columns, whereas [Lists](/components/in-field/lists/) can only be stacked vertically in a single column.

## Usage

#### Use when

- User needs to easily scan and compare data.
- User needs to view and edit data.
- Manipulating and navigating through a large amount of data.
- Previewing data before drilling down further.

#### Don’t use when

- You only have a small data set.
- A more detailed amount of information needs to be displayed by default.
- There is more than one piece of information within a cell.
