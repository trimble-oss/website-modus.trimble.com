## Accessibility

- The element that opens the menu has role `button`.
- The element with role `button` has `aria-haspopup` set to either `menu` or `true`.
- When the menu is displayed, the element with role `button` has `aria-expanded` set to `true`. When the menu is hidden, it is recommended that `aria-expanded` is not present. If `aria-expanded` is specified when the menu is hidden, it is set to `false`.
- The element that contains the menu items displayed by activating the button has role `menu`.
- Optionally, the element with role `button` has a value specified for `aria-controls` that refers to the element with role `menu`.
- With focus on the button, “Enter” or <kbd>Space</kbd> opens the menu and places focus on the first menu item. Up and down arrows move focus through menu items.
