## Overview

The scrollbar is for both showing a user that content in a container overflows and for the user to control the scrolling content of that container. Always offer a scrollbar if an area has scrolling content: do not rely on auto-scrolling or on dragging. Scrollbars can be both vertical and horizontal. However, **avoid horizontal scrolling**, if possible.

**Note:** Checkboxes for touchscreen apps: this component includes a large, invisible touch target around the checkbox and Label to ensure high usability.

## Usage

**Use when**

- An area has scrolling content.
- Allow users to easily navigate through the content without having to
zoom in and out or swipe.
- If a touch screen does not support gestures or the bar needs to be clearly visible, use button scrolling.

**Don't use when**

- All the content is visible.
- Horizontal scrolling can be replaced with a better option.
