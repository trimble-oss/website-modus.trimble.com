## Overview

Lists are used to present information in well-formed and organized way. The user can view or take action on list line items.

A list displays related content in a vertical format. A list is typically the focus of the screen and composes the main body of the screen layout. Lists are composed of list items.

List items should be of a similar and obvious category of information (i.e., a list of design files, or a list of point locations). A list item contains at least a label in a consistent format that helps the user to scan and read the content efficiently.

The list order should be carefully considered. Examples of list orders include most recently used first, date created, alphabetical, or numeric value. The user may also filter the list to show certain content. Use filters judiciously.

## Usage

**Use when**

- Creating vertical navigation.
- Displaying options within a menu.

**Don't use when**

- Displaying tabular data. Instead, use a table.
- Making lists of uncategorized information. Use groups of list items to organize similar content.

## Types

There are two kinds of lists: standard and spaced. Spaced lists are for in-field experiences that need larger tap target area to prevent users from choosing the wrong item.
