## Specifications

- Using secondary icon-only buttons at 32x32 is recommended, see [Buttons](/components/web/buttons/).
- To provide a distinction of the floating toolbar and create the floating effect, a shadow (Level 3) is used. See [Shadows & Depth](/foundations/shadows-and-depth/).
- The icon buttons can be aligned as a row (horizontally) or as a column (vertically).
- Vertically aligned floating toolbars are usually located on the left or right side of the screen; Horizontally aligned floating toolbars reside at the top or bottom of the application window.
