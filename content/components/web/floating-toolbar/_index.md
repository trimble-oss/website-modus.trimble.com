## Overview

A floating toolbar is a row or column of icon [Buttons](/components/web/buttons/) used to activate controls in an application. It can consist of a series of icon buttons separated or combined together. Floating toolbars are fixed in one position on the screen. Typically, a floating toolbar is placed on left or right side or on top or bottom of the application window.

A floating toolbar allows for a maximum workspace and maintains an unobstructed view of the UI content.

## Usage

#### Use when

- Full-screen usage and unobstructed view of the content is critical, e.g., in graphic applications.
- Providing a contextual menu benefits the userâ€™s productivity.
- Offering tools near to the objects being worked on is essential.

#### Don't use when

- You need to navigate between content within the application. Instead, use [Side Navigation](/components/web/side-navigation/) or [Content Tree](/components/web/content-tree/).
- A more robust set of tools needs to be displayed. Instead, use [Utility Panel](/components/web/utitlity-panel/).
- Actions are directly coupled with specific elements on the page.

## Types

Floating toolbars can be classified by their layout as follows:

**Floating toolbar consisting of a series of separate buttons:**

- Icon buttons are aligned next to each other (horizontally or vertically), but not connected.

**Floating toolbar consisting of a series of combined icon buttons:**

- Icon buttons are connected vertically or horizontally.
