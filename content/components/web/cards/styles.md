### Behaviors

- Cards should only contain a single action, which is tied to a UI component within the action element or to the whole card (using a card as a link).

### Editorial

- **Label:** Keep labels one to three words long, if possible, to avoid wrapping.
- **Title:** Keep titles one to five words long, if possible, to avoid wrapping. Use title case and capitalize prepositions of four letters or more.
- **Caption:** Use full sentences with punctuation, no longer than 40 words if possible. Do not include multiple paragraphs.
- **Action:** Follow the editorial guidelines for [Buttons](/components/web/buttons/), [Chips](/components/web/chips/), etc. when using those elements.
- **Metadata:** Keep metadata one to five words long to avoid wrapping.
