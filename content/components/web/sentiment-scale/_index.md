## Overview

A sentiment scale is an instant, engaging, and typically easy-to-use way to collect user feedback using a series of emoticons. An emoticon (smiley symbol) is universally understood and provides accurate experience feedback. On a typically five-tier emoticon rating scale, users instinctively select the level of positive, negative, or neutral expression that reflects their experience with a user interface. The clarity of sentiment scales promotes a high response rate to increase user satisfaction and define insights for future improvements.

## Usage

**Use when**

- Collecting instant feedback in an efficient manner right after interaction, typically with a mobile app or website.
- Exploring if online help articles provide users with the information they need to be successful when using a product or service.

**Don’t use when**

- In-depth qualitative feedback needs to be measured that cannot or should not be measured quickly and superficially.
- Complex technical context is required to explain the question.
