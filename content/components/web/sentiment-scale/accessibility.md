## Accessibility

- See [Radio Buttons](/components/web/radio-buttons/), [Chips](/components/web/chips/), [Cards](/components/web/cards/), and [Tooltips](/components/web/tooltips/) for accessibility guidelines.
- A sentiment scale must have noticeable text that clearly describes the destination, purpose, function, or action of each emoticon for screen reader users.
- The `aria-label` is useful for adding accessible names to elements such as emoticons that do not have visible labels but require a concise call for action. Use a hidden `aria-label` attribute when a visible text label is not needed.
