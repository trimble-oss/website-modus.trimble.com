## Accessibility

- Use a wrapping `<nav>` element to identify it as a navigation section to screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- Pagination is built with the ordered list `ol` HTML elements, so screen readers can announce the number of available links.
- As pages likely have more than one such navigation section, itâ€™s advisable to provide a descriptive `aria-label` for the `<nav>` to reflect its purpose. For example, if the pagination component is used to navigate between a set of search results, an appropriate label could be `aria-label="Search results pages"`.
