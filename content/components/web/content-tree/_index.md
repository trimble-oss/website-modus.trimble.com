## Overview

A content tree provides users with a way to navigate nested hierarchical information using a parent-child relationship model. It is located on the left side of the screen and cannot be combined with Side Navigation or Toolbar.

## Usage

#### Use when

- You have nested, hierarchical information.
- You want to manage hierarchical data and information.

#### Don't use when

- You need to navigate between pages of an application. Instead use [Side Navigation](/components/web/side-navigation/).
- You need to display actions a user may take to manipulate content within an application (i.e. edit, erase, rotate, etc.). Instead use a [Toolbar](/components/web/toolbar/).
- You want a folder to collapse when another folder opens (instead, use an [Accordion](/components/web/accordions/)).
