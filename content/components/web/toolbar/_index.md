## Overview

A toolbar is a floating element consisting of a row or a column of icon butttons used to activate controls in an application. It can consist of a series of icon buttons separated or combined together. Toolbars are fixed in one position on the screen.

A toolbar allows for a maximum workspace and maintains an unobstructed view of the UI content.

## Usage

#### Use when

- Full-screen usage and unobstructed view of the content is critical, e.g., in graphic applications.
- Providing a contextual menu benefits the userâ€™s productivity.
- Offering tools near to the objects being worked on is essential.

#### Don't use when

- You need to navigate between content within the application. Instead, use [Side Navigation](/components/web/side-navigation/) or [Content Tree](/components/web/content-tree/).
- A more robust set of tools needs to be displayed. Instead, use [Utility Panel](/components/web/utility-panel/).
- Actions are directly coupled with specific elements on the page.

## Types

Toolbars can be classified by their layout as follows:

### With Separate Buttons

Icon buttons are aligned next to each other (horizontally or vertically), but not connected.

### With Combined Buttons

Icon buttons are connected vertically or horizontally.
