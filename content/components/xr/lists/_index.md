## Overview

List items can contain actions represented by icons.

Lists act like buttons, that means by default they react to the push action of the index finger of users.

They can encompass two outcomes, which can exclusively be combined through a pre-command, usually a button, that would toggle the two default interactions, namely:

- **Open:** access relevant information
- **Select:** mark list item(s) for further action (e.g., delete)

## Usage

**Use when**

- Creating vertical navigation.
- Displaying options within a menu.
- List items are especially suitable for text and data, through a layout that is easy to scan and read.

**Don't use when**

- Variable, graphic-heavy items should be better displayed through cards.
- Displaying multiple parameter data. Consider creating a table for this purpose.

## Types

Lists are qualified by content type.

  <thead class="thead-light">
