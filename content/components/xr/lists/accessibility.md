XR Interfaces are bound to interaction types.  Modus XR Lists cater touch interactions with UIs placed by default at 50cm (~20 Inch) from users.

## Accessibility

- Lists should be distinctively labeled.
- The list height is locked at 96x32px or mm.
- Width is flexible and up to UI parameters to be defined.
- Tooltips on hover provide additional insight for lists' titles.
