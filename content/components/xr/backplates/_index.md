## Overview

Backplates provide visual contrast and helps to connect other elements and components within graphic interfaces.  Their purpose is to support the overall design of the interface and improve the user experience, delivering visual hierarchy and structure to the interfaces.

Modus’s backplates are made up of solid colors following the two main themes, transparent and classic.

The decision to use or avoid a backplate ultimately depends on the specific requirements of your user interface design.

## Usage

**Use when**

- Diverse UI elements & components are required to execute a function
- Basic elements “float in space” and could merge with the environment
- You need to bring cohesion to the experience

**Don't use when**

- Its use can obstruct the user’s experience
- Highlighting areas of real or virtual content would be deterred through their use

## Types

Backplates can be static, or be ruled by solvers, or be interactive in nature (grabbable), but fit with solvers to enhance the experience and discoverability.  Their use and behavior depend on the type of experience the use case requires.
