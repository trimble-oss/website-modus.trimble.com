XR Interfaces are bound to interaction types and ergonomic requirements.  Modus XR Sliders cater touch interactions with UIs placed by default at 50cm (~20 Inch) from users. However considering that sliders can be placed on menus or UIs controlled by users and highly dependent on their freedom of movement, readability and discoverability can be impacted.  Therefore experiences using sliders need careful attention in the relation between users, content, action and impact.

## Accessibility
- Sliders size is determined by the experience.  Grips use 32 and 24-height components.
