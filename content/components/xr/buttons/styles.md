## Specifications

- All buttons should be interactive and perform an action.
- They should be discoverable, easy to identify, and specific.
- Provide voice command label to ease interaction.
- If using multiple buttons, label them distinctly.
- The size of the buttons should be used in proportion to the context and content around it.

**_Touch = UIs placed at 50cm (~20 Inch) from users_**

Buttons are bound to ergonomic requirements, do not scale them below 24mm. Scaling up beyond 60x60mm should foresee a full-hand push as common interaction.
