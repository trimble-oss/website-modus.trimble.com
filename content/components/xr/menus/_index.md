## Overview

Menus appear when users interact with a button, action, or other control. They can be opened from a variety of elements, most commonly buttons.

However in XR, menus can also be assigned to a gesture or control command that takes care of invoking them.

Designers can define a variety of menus, depending on the use cases. Among them, most common menus could be:

- **General:** commands are constant across environments and experiences.
- **Contextual:** commands are exclusively relevant to a feature.

## Usage

#### Use when

- Displaying a list of command choices on a surface.
- Displaying multiple, non-obvious commands, and options.
- Offering an option to close and/or unpin.
- Enabling voice commands or gaze-control for users with limited accessibility.

#### Don't use when

- Performing actions with a model or spatial interfaces that could either interfere with the flow or perception of the center of attention.
- Immediate, decisive actions that require full user attention is needed.

## Types

Menus are qualified by positioning and interaction.

### Hand Menus:

Hand menus are interaction patterns that allow users to invoke features of an application and/or environment within an app, bounding actions to the palm-up gesture.

### Near Menus:

Near Menus by default tag along usersâ€™ radius. However, all variants have a grabbable version with a bottom handle that allow users to place the menu where they find it convenient.
