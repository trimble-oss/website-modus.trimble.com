## Accessibility

XR Interfaces are bound to interaction types and ergonomic requirements. Modus XR Menus cater touch interactions with UIs placed by default at 50cm (~20 inch) from users. However, Hand and Near Menus' positions are controlled by users and highly dependent on their freedom of movement, impacting readability and discoverability. Therefore, experiences using menus need careful attention in the relation between users, content, action and impact.

- Menus should be distinctively discoverable.
- Menu size is determined by the experience. Touch UIs use 32-height components.
- Consider interaction patterns to summon UIs within users' field of view.
- Consider non-graphical UIs to summon UIs within users' field of view.
