## Overview

Tooltips are overlaid on the primary object of attention for the user. They inform and overlay on the content.

Tooltips remain informative and should not be considered actionable.  For that matter, preferably use a button.

In XR they provide insight into a virtual object, by using tooltips bound/anchored/attached to a model's part. Use them as well to provide insight into a real object, which has been identified or was previously embedded in the deviceâ€™s memory.

In the case of truncated interface texts, tooltips complete information, so that users can take a decision or start an action.  These are triggered through interactions like proximity, gaze or hover and are therefore temporary.


## Usage

**Use when**

- Providing a short description of a page element or control.
- Revealing the full text of truncated data.
- For non-essential information, consider using plain text messages


**Don't use when**

- Providing a description longer than 10 words.
- Buttons require more information.  That will be covered by voice command hints
