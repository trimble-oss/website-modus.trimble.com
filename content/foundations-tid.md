Trimble ID (TID) is Trimble’s single sign-on across all Trimble applications. “Trimble ID” is the official terminology used for all customer-facing material. Trimble ID (TID) acts as a Trimble passport that provides users with a seamless authentication experience across the Trimble ecosystem.

## Can I Brand the TID Sign-In Page?

In previous versions of TID, there was extensive customization available for all pages related to the login process. This resulted in an inconsistent look-and-feel across Trimble applications. As we begin to focus more on user experience, a consistent look for our sign-in page is needed to convey a sense of unity to our customers. For this reason, there is limited customizability for the TID v4 sign-in page.

Modus components are used to align Trimble UX guidelines and ensure a cohesive and consistent brand experience. The splash screen graphic is brand-approved and not customizable. For more information on branding strategy, please visit [Trimble Brand Resources](https://brand.trimble.com/).

## Anatomy

![Anatomy of the TID sign-in page](/img/news/tid-anatomy.svg)

1. **Product Name Space** (customizable): Your product name will appear here.

2. **Trimble Branded Image Space**: This is brand-approved and will be static across all applications.

3. **Native and Social Sign-In Options**: This will be static across all applications and devices.

_Note: On smaller device screens, only the Trimble logo displays._

## Responsive Design

The sign-in page is designed to be responsive so the user experience is unified across all devices. The design adheres to Modus [Grid & Spacing](/foundations/grid-and-spacing/) guidelines.

### Large Screens

For larger screens, such as laptops and devices connected to a monitor, the sign-in panel  appears on the screen’s right side.

### Medium Screens

For medium screens, such as on a tablet, the sign-in panel is centered.
