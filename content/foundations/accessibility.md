## Introduction

All components in Modus are built with accessibility in mind. Studies estimate that about one fifth (20%) of the population has some kind of disability. Even though that number might be significantly lower for our users, keeping accessibility in mind is not only a good practice, but it also may have serious legal implications especially as it relates to government contracts.

In an effort to be inclusive, here at Trimble we want to build products for everyone and to be compliant with the law. To that end, Modus components are compliant with [The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://webaim.org/articles/laws/usa/ada) and the [Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Sections 504 and Section 508)](https://webaim.org/articles/laws/usa/rehab) and follows the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/).

Major categories of disabilities include visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive, with each category requiring a certain type of adaptation in the design of web and desktop products. For help with implementation, we include a checklist that you can add to the acceptance criteria.
