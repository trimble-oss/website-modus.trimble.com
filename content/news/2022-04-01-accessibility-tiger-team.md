All components in Modus are built with accessibility in mind. Studies estimate that about one fifth (20%) of the population has some kind of disability. Even though that number might be significantly lower for our users, keeping accessibility in mind is not only a good practice, but it also may have serious legal implications especially as it relates to government contracts.

In an effort to be inclusive, we want to build products for everyone and to be compliant with WCAG 2.1, ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Sections 504 and 508). If you are passionate about inclusive design and development practices, join our Accessibility Tiger Team!

The Tiger Team will be review all existing Modus design patterns and code components to make sure they are accessible and follow the WCAG AA compliance and will write accessibility guidelines for future components. They will also review the recommendations and approve code components to make sure they meet all requirements.

Joining is easy! Volunteer by filling out the form below by **April 13, 2022**. [Learn more about the Tiger Team process](/community/tiger-teams/).
