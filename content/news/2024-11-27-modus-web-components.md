After three and a half years worth of updates to our Modus Web COmponents library we've got around to publishing v1.0.0!

We've been working hard on improving the library and making it easier to use for everyone. Here are some of the highlights from our progress this year:

## Component Updates

We've added lots of new features, and fixed a lot of issues across most of our components.

In particular, the [Table component](https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/?path=/docs/components-table--docs) has seen a huge number of improvements.

## Storybook v8 Update

The Modus Web Components site has had a big update to the latest version of Storybook which brings with it an improved user interface, faster load times and many other quality of life updates.

## Deploy Previews - powered by Netlify

We are now using Netlify's Deploy Previews feature to preview changes to our components library on every pull request made - even from external contributors. This has been a huge improvement for our workflow, as it allows us to see changes in real-time and test them before merging them into the main branch.

We were happy to talk with Netlify about our experience using the platform for a [post on the Netlify blog](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2024/05/09/trimble-modus-design-system/).

## External Contributors

The Modus Web Components library has always been open source, MIT licensed and available for anyone to use and contribute to.

We've been really happy that front-end developer [Austin O'Neil](https://github.com/austinoneil), a developer from the community, has been contributing to the project (he's now had 19 merged Pull Requests!) and has been a great help in improving the library.

Thanks Austin!
