Add the designs you created using the Modus components and patterns and check what other designers within Trimble are creating.

### Why are we doing this?

Modus Design System is great at defining the building blocks of our designs but because of the scale of the work and the many products we are working on, we often find ourselves needing to see how other designers solved a similar problem that we are trying to solve and that is why we created this space.

Below are our goals for it:

- **Inspiration**: This is a space where you can get inspired as a designer and share ideas of the work that you’ve been doing using Modus library.
- **Problem solving**: It’s also a space where you can see how other designers solved similar problems that you are encountering in your product.
- **Learning**: It’s also a space where we can possibly uncover where Modus might need to fill the gap and possibly add more guidelines to the system.
- **Connect and Scale**: This might help us with our connect and scale initiative by helping us standardize solutions for certain modules or features and giving us more visibility on what is being designed across different products.

### What are we looking for?

We want you to add the complex organisms and page designs that you created using the Modus system. We are interested in how you used the Modus components and patterns to design features and pages.
