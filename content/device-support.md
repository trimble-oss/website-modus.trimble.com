The Trimble suite of products spans a plethora of business sectors, technology platforms (e.g. web-based, mobile, desktop, etc), frontend languages and technology stacks (e.g. Angular, Java, HTML/CSS, etc), work applications (in office, in the field, in a machine, etc) and devices (tablets, phones, laptops, desktops, and Trimble HW).

In order to ensure different teams can build beautiful, consistent user experiences, the current release of Modus is targeted at the supported environments outlined below.
